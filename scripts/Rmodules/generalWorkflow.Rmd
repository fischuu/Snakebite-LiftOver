# General workflow

## Directed acyclic graph (DAG)

In Snakemake, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a graphical representation of the dependencies between the rules or tasks in a Snakemake workflow. The nodes in the DAG represent the rules or tasks, and the edges between the nodes represent the dependencies between them.

The DAG is constructed automatically by Snakemake based on the dependencies specified in the Snakefile, a file containing the rules and dependencies for a Snakemake workflow. When a rule is specified in the Snakefile, it is added to the DAG as a node. If the rule has dependencies on other rules, those dependencies are added to the DAG as edges between the nodes.

The DAG is used by Snakemake to determine the order in which the rules or tasks should be executed. It ensures that the rules are executed in a way that satisfies all of the dependencies between them, and that no rule is executed before all of its dependencies have been completed.

```{r import workflow, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Overview of the applied workflow", out.width = '100%'}
if(file.exists(file.path(projFolder,"workflow.png"))) knitr::include_graphics(file.path(projFolder,"workflow.png"))
```
